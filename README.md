# Internstudio_taskno1
I am excited to share that I have completed my first task BMI Calculator task during my internship with InternStudio! it highlights the steps and logic behind the implementation. Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters),and logic to calculate BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height). Display the calculated BMI along with a message indicating the user's BMI category (e.g.underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).
Grateful for this opportunity to learn and grow.
